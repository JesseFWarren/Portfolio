        <h1 class = "intro">Capstone Project: Autonomus Vehicle Detection AI Software</h1>
        <p class = "introText">Skillion HawkEye is a mounted bike camera that warns the bike rider of any approaching vehicles. It takes in the camera data of the surrounding environment and runs inference to determine a hazard level. Then, it communicates the information to the user via a mobile app running on a phone mounted to the handlebars. The goal of HawkEye is to create a product that protects bike riders from unseen hazards.
        </p>
        <p class = "p2"> Our teams goal for this project was to create a modified machine learning model with python and tensorflow that is faster in identifying vehicles and able estimate their trajectory and speed better than the company's existing model to provide a better indication of hazard. In addition, it will be better at locating vehicles far away, to provide a head start for the hazard prediction algorithm. It will also be able to detect cars in all light levels including low-light conditions.
        </p>
        <p class = p3>
            In the first half of our project timeline we have succesfully created a faster, better performing model that works well in all light conditions as well as a collection of Python scripts for augmenting our image dataset and performing fine-tuned training and evaluation using the IoU algorithm.
