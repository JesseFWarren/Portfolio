        <h1 class = "introElsetic">Elsetic Software Development Internship</h1>
        <p class = "introTextElsetic">As a software developer for Elsetic I worked on the development of a new application that is meant to be a social network for new business where they can post ideas about project and solutions to easily gain feedback from the public.
        </p>
        <p class="ElseticP2">Using the agile process and sprint increments I led my team in the development from planning stages to execution. The app consisted of a Mobile frontend, a Web frontend, and a backend to communicate with the server and update the database. 
        </p>
        <p class="ElseticP3">Outside of the projects management,
            I spend much of my time working on the mobile frontend through android studio using flutter as I was the only member of my team with this sort of experience. We were able to make great process on this application and pass the work along to the next group of interns
            to continue development.</p>
