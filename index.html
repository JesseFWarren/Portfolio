        <h1 class = "intro">Hi, my name is Jesse Warren</h1>
        <p class = "introText">I just graduated from Lehigh University with two bachelor's degrees, one in computer science and one in business. This fall I will begin my Masters of Engineering degree in Artificial Intelligence and Product Innovation at Duke University. 
            I'm involved in many computer science disciplines such as artificial intelligence, data science and analytics, cyber security, software engineering, and business disciplines such as general management and marketing.
        </p>
        <p class = introText2>My dual degree grants me technology skills in software development and a solid understanding in business and economics giving me a diverse background and the ability to understand the whole business 
            and communicate technical and complex terminology in a way that anyone can understand.
        </p>
        <p class = introText3>In addition to a great attention to detail and a keen eye for efficiency improvements, I have experience in many programming languages including but not limited to: Python, C, C++, Java, SQL, HTML, C#, Javascript, and R. </p>
